# Task 6 - Repo visualisation using D3.js
Using the GitHub API to build a visualisation of the available data in order to elucidate some aspect of the softare engineering process.


## General info
- Open `index.html` using your browser to run.
- Please use a modern browser version. <sub>(I tested it on a recent version of Chrome and a 2 year old version of Firefox and it works as expected. It didn't work on as expected on Internet Explorer 11 though.)</sub>
- As you most likely know, Github API access is limited to anonymous users. In order to be able to use all of the API features, Github requires for the user to be authenticated. For that reason you must log
  in order to use this app.

## How to use
1. Log in.
1. On the left sidebar you will see two options:
    1. Your repos
    1. Other repos
1. "Your repos" displays all your repos, including private repos.
1. "Other repos" displays my repos by default. You are free to type any username into the search bar and press go in order to see their repos.
1. By clicking on a repo, the main view will change to display the current file structure of the selected repo.
1. Use the on screen arrows or the left and right keys on the keyboard to cycle through the repo's commit history and see how the file structure looked at that point in time.
1. Hover over a folder name to see its contents.
1. To view another repo, select an available one from the side bar or type in a different username into the search bar and press "GO".

# Task 1 - Lowest Common Ancestor Problem
A solution to the Lowest Common Ancestor Problem and extensive testing to make sure the solution is valid.


## Overview

### Quick description
- A tree (`Tree.java`) is made up of many nodes (`Node.java`).
- A tree has one `root` node.
- Each `Node` has optional `left` and `right` nodes.
- Each `Node` also has a pointer to its `parent`.

### Testing
All the JUnit tests are located in `Tesing.java`. In the next section are images of the trees that were for testing.

## The Trees from `Testing.java`

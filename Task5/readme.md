# Task 5 - Github Access
Interrogating the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.


## General info
- Because the next part of the project requires the use of D3, I decided to just use Javascript to interrogate the Github API.
- Open `index.html` using your browser to run.
- Please use a modern browser version. <sub>(I tested it on a recent version of Chrome and a 2 year old version of Firefox and it works as expected. It didn't work on as expected on Internet Explorer 11 though.)</sub>
- As you most likely know, Github API access is limited to anonymous users. In order to be able to use all of the API features, Github requires for the user to be authenticated. For that reason you must log
  in order to use this app.

## How to use
1. Log in.
1. On the left sidebar you will see two options:
    1. Your repos
    1. Other repos
1. Your repos displays all your repos, including private repos.
1. Other repos displays my repos by default. You are free to type any username into the search bar and press go in order to see their repos.
1. By clicking on a repo, the main view will change to display unprocessed data from the Github API regarding that repo.
